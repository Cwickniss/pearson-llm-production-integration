# LLMs from Prototypes to Production

![O'Reilly](images/oreilly.png)

## Description

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the course ["LLMs from Prototypes to Production"](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/llms-from-prototypes-to-production/0636920095639/) by Sinan Ozdemir. Published by Pearson, the course covers effective best practices and industry case studies in using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Once you understand how large language models (LLMs) work, define your prompts, and train your models, it’s time to move your LLM prototypes to production and fine-tune your models for optimal performance. We will cover the best practices for integrating LLMs into various workflows, deployment options, and model evaluation. This course will empower you to confidently transition from LLM prototypes to fully realized applications and optimize their performance.

This course is the third in a three-part series by Sinan Ozdemir designed for machine learning engineers and software developers who want to expand their skillset and learn how to work with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and FLAN-T5. The courses provide practical instruction on prompt engineering, language modeling, moving LLM prototypes to production, and fine-tuning GPT models. The three live courses in the series are:

LLMs, GPT, and Prompt Engineering for Developers
Using Open- and Closed-Source LLMs in Real-World Applications
LLMs from Prototypes to Production
The book Quick Start Guide to LLMs by Sinan Ozdemir is recommended as companion material for for post-class reference.
